# Creation of React from 0 âš›

Little project making homemade React to learn how internally works ,
in one file I create :

- elements and components inside of Virtual-DOM
- render function to paint Virtual-DOM
- useState system
- Suspense simple functional recreation 

All this is used in a cute reactive count and input text component
